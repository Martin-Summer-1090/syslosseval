    exposure data for the EBA transparency exercise 2020 and data on the average daily volume of sovereign bond turnover
    for a number of selected countries as well as broad bond indices for these countries.
    The data are compiled as described in the paper using raw data retrieved from publicly available data on the WWW. The
